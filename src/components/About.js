            Hi, I'm Tom - an undergraduate at Oxford University reading Materials Science. I also like to code - and so I thought I'd put this website together as a place to collate my projects.

            Most of my experience is in Javascript, Python, and Matlab, although I have done some Lisp, C++, and Java in my time. (I'm always trying to learn more!)

            Please get in touch if you have any questions!
